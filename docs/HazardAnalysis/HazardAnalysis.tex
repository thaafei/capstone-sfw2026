\section{Introduction}


This Hazard Analysis identifies and evaluates potential risks associated with
the Neural Network Libraries (NNL) Assessment Tool, a web-based application that
automates evidence collection, data storage, and visualization for assessing
open-source neural network libraries. 

In this context, a hazard is defined as any condition, event, or design
decision that could lead to loss of data integrity, software malfunction,
degraded performance, or failure to meet stakeholder requirements.

The tool integrates React (frontend), Flask (backend), a relational database
(e.g., MySQL), and public Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), such as the
GitHub API, to support automated data gathering, Analytic Hierarchy Process
(AHP)--based ranking, and visualization of software-quality metrics.

Because the system involves data integration, user interaction, and deployment
on university infrastructure, it faces technical and operational hazards (for
example, integration errors, API limits, or performance bottlenecks). This
document identifies such risks early in the lifecycle to protect software
reliability, data integrity, and user experience.

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

The purpose of this hazard analysis is to systematically identify potential
risks that could impact the reliability, usability, and delivery of the NNL
Assessment Tool.

Although the tool is non-safety-critical, losses could still occur through:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Data loss or corruption, affecting research integrity.
    \item System downtime, delaying project milestones or access for the research team.
    \item Inaccurate visualizations or metrics, leading to incorrect conclusions in research outputs.
    \item Security breaches, risking exposure of user accounts or evaluation data.
    \item Integration failures, which could prevent essential automation and data collection.
\end{itemize}

These losses would directly reduce the tool’s credibility, hinder academic
progress, and compromise user trust.

The analysis focuses on identifying, classifying, and mitigating these hazards
early to minimize risks and ensure project success.

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

The following explain the System Components:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Admin UI: Handles invitation, domain creation, and user management views.
    \item Researcher UI: Handles data input, update, and visualization controls.
    \item User Management: Handles logic for invite/sign-up, login, roles, and password reset.
    \item Domain Data Service: Handles read and write operations for Domains, Libraries, and Metrics.
    \item AHP Ranking: Handles the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) calculation.
    \item Visualization: Handles graph generation.
    \item Export: Handles data downloads (JSON/Excel)
    \item Security: Handles Access Control, validation, encrypt password, and manages audit trails.
    \item Persistence: Handles storage and retrieval for all data entities.
    \item System DB: The underlying data store.
\end{itemize}

\section{Critical Assumptions}

The following assumptions support hazard identification and mitigation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Access to Public APIs:} It is assumed that GitHub API and other
    data sources will remain stable; however, if access limits or outages occur,
    fallback mechanisms (e.g., cached data, manual upload) will be implemented.
    
    \item \textbf{McMaster Infrastructure Availability:} University servers will
    host the tool; if unavailable, contingency hosting (local or alternative
    cloud) will be explored.
    
    \item \textbf{Stable Development Team:} All members remain active; if a
    member becomes unavailable, roles and documentation ensure continuity.
    
    \item \textbf{Non-Safety-Critical Context:} Hazards relate to data and
    usability, not physical harm, but errors could still cause loss of
    credibility or project delays.
    
    \item \textbf{Defined Scope and Requirements:} Requirements remain stable;
    changes will trigger re-assessment of risks.
    
    \item \textbf{Version Control and Standards:} Git workflow reduces
    integration errors, though merge conflicts remain possible; peer reviews
    mitigate these.
    
    \item \textbf{User Feedback Availability:} Testing feedback will be
    accessible; if delayed, internal testing will substitute temporarily.
\end{itemize}

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}
The hazard analysis revealed several safety-related requirements that were not fully covered in the SRS.
These requirements aim to prevent data loss, improve user experience during failures, and keep the tool reliable.

\subsection*{Clear Error Feedback and Account Recovery}
The system must show clear error messages (e.g., wrong password, network failure) and give users a way to reset their credentials if they forget them.

\subsection*{Correct Role Assignment}
User roles (Viewer / Contributor) must be assigned and saved correctly at sign-up or when updated by an admin so that permissions are always accurate.

\subsection*{Protecting Manual Edits from Automated Updates}
If automated data refreshes could overwrite a user’s manual entry, the system must warn the user or ask for confirmation before replacing the data.

\subsection*{Preventing Conflicting Edits}
When two people try to edit the same record at the same time, the tool must either block one of the saves or clearly warn the users to avoid losing data.

\subsection*{Consistent Visualization}
Publishing visualizations must not happen at the same time as ongoing data edits.
The system should either block publishing during edits or enforce a short downtime so charts and scores always reflect a stable dataset.

\subsection*{Reliable Download of Data and Visuals}
If an export (CSV, PNG, etc.) fails or the file is corrupted, the tool must alert the user and, where possible, let them retry the download.

\section{Roadmap}

For the Capstone timeline, we will focus on the safety features that are needed to make the tool work properly:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Login with account recovery so that users can sign in securely.
    \item Correct role assignment (Viewer / Contributor) so only authorized users can edit data.
    \item A basic warning when automated updates might overwrite manual edits.
    \item Reliable downloads for tables and charts, with a simple error message if something goes wrong.
\end{itemize}

Some features will be added later as future improvements:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A better system to prevent publishing visualizations while edits are happening (for example, temporary downtime or blocking the publish button).
    \item A stronger solution for conflicting edits, such as proper locking or live conflict warnings.
    \item More advanced error handling for things like failed downloads or export retries.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\wss{Not required for CAS 741}

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable?
    \\\textbf{Haniye:} One thing that went well was that looking at the hazards helped us spot requirements we hadn’t considered before. Thinking through the risks made certain scenarios much clearer, like what happens if login fails or downloaded file is corrupted.
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \\\textbf{Haniye:} One challenge was figuring out which safety features to prioritize for the Capstone demo and which to leave for later. After looking at the project scope, we agreed to focus on the most essential features that would keep the tool stable and reliable for the demo.
    \item Which of your listed risks had your team thought of before this
    deliverable, and which did you think of while doing this deliverable? For
    the latter ones (ones you thought of while doing the Hazard Analysis), how
    did they come about?
    \\\textbf{Haniye:} Some hazards were already on our radar but only partially covered in the original requirements. For example, we had noted the risk of conflicting edits and planned to keep a record of changes, but we hadn’t considered that the system should also block or warn other users editing the same record. Similarly, we knew we’d have different user roles, but we overlooked the need to handle role assignment correctly in the database. Other risks, like login failures or charts showing incomplete data, only came up as we worked through the hazard analysis and FMEA table.
    \item Other than the risk of physical harm (some projects may not have any
    appreciable risks of this form), list at least 2 other types of risk in
    software products. Why are they important to consider?
    \\\textbf{Haniye:} N/A
