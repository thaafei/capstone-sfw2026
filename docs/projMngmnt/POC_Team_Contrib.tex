\section{CICD}
We use GitHub Actions to automate the building and compiling the changed latex files in our main branch.
Members are allowed to merge their changes into the feature branch once all comments were resolved.
When at least two members of the team has approved the changes to merge the feature branch into the main branch, members can merge the feature branch into main. \\

\wss{Add CI/CD of code once implemented}

\item{All deliverables must meet the team's agreed-upon standards}
\item{Deliverables must be reviewed by all team members before submission}
\item{Feedback on deliverables and revisions must be made within 7 days}

\subsection{Next Step Plans}
% \wss{Provide a plan to address the violations.  This could include revising the
% triggers, if they are found to be too weak, strong or ambiguous.}
Triggers 4 and 5 must be revised. \\
\textbf{4.} Deliverables must be reviewed by all assigned team members through the "reviewed" confirmation on GitHub, before deliverables are ready to be merged. \\
\textbf{5.} Feedback on deliverables must be given in 24 hours after a review is requested. 
\\\\
Additional trigger will be added:\\
\textbf{6.} All feedback must be resolved at least 2 days before the deadline of the deliverable.\\
If feedback is not provided in time, or resolved in time, a callout will be posted in the team's Discord channel. This will be used as evidence if further issues occur.
\section{Additional Productivity Metrics}
No additional productivity metric is used by the team. We have a team feedback survey, the following which allows members to anonymously provide feedback to each team member.
